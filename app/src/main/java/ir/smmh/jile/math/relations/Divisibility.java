/**
 * The notion of a {@link Divisor} arose within the arithmetic of whole numbers.
 * With the development of abstract rings, of which the integers are the
 * archetype, the original notion of divisor found a natural extension.
 * <p>
 * Divisibility is a useful concept for the analysis of the structure of
 * commutative rings because of its relationship with the ideal structure of
 * such rings.
