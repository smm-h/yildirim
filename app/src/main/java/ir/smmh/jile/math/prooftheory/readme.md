# Proof theory

As a branch of logic, it studies formal proofs as inductively-defined data structures such as plain lists, boxed lists, or trees, which are constructed according to the axioms and rules of inference of the logical system. Proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to [model theory](../modeltheory/readme.md), which is semantic in nature.
