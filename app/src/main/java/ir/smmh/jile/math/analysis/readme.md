# Analysis

Analysis is the study of limits and other related theories such as differentiation, integration, measure, infinite series, and analytic functions, in the context of real and complex numbers and functions. Analysis is the generalization of [calculus](../calculus/readme.md), which involves the elementary concepts and techniques of analysis.
